Shunt 5V(ish) zener diode to protect Arduino analog in pin.
One LED per scale range to indicate which is active (5V, 12V, 24V).
LED to indicate if in OVERVOLTAGE state.
4-digit 7-segment display. This has the added benefit of being able to cleanly display the 0-1023 ADC value for debug.
Terminal lugs for probes?
3 SPST relays to enable path to each scale's voltage divider top resistor. Solid state relays?
Common bottom voltage divider resistor.
Scales:
	6V (5V nominal)		0 Ohm 		+ 10 kOhm
	15V (12V nominal) 	20 kOhm 	+ 10 kOhm
	30V (24V nominal)	49.9 kOhm 	+ 10 kOhm
All resistors can be 1/16 W. Which package? 0402? Maybe package that matches LEDs?
